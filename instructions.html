            <li>Start by building a base. To build a base use a grey 8 x 6 rectangular lego piece. On top of the grey lego piece attach a 4x4 blue square lego piece. </li>
            <li>Gather two yellow transparent Lego pieces. Put each Lego piece in the middle of the shorter side of the grey rectangular piece. </li>
            <li>Gather two white and two red circular pieces of Lego and place them in front of the blue square Lego piece. The order of the pieces should be one red and one white.</li>
            <li>We will now build the robot. Start by adding the legs. For legs, we will use two light blue blocks.</li>
            <li>Place each block on the side of the blue square base.</li>
            <li>On top of the two blocks add a 2x4 grey rectangular lego piece. </li>
            <li>Add three blue blocks creating a U shape on top of the 2x4 rectangular block.</li>
            <li>Add two single grey blocks in the space left on the 2x4 rectangular block between the three U-shaped blocks.</li>
            <li>Let's make the arms and torso. To do that, gather two blue curved Lego pieces and attach them to the corner of the blue blocks. In the middle of the two curved Lego blocks add a red rectangular piece.</li>
            <li>Add a grey single-line rectangular piece in front of the curved and red Lego piece. Also, add a red and yellow circular Lego piece in front of the torso.</li>
            <li>Let's make the neck. Gather a white 2x4 rectangular piece and add it on top of the torso. On top of that piece add a red square lego piece with five holes. On top of the red square add a 2x2 circular piece with a leg that goes in one of the holes on the square piece.</li>
            <li>Let's add the eyes on the side holes of the blue singular blocks. Between the eyes add a three-line rectangular Lego piece making a face.</li>
            <li>Let's add the robot Antenna on top of the head. To do that use a black Lego head. On top of the black Lego head add a shiny red circular piece. </li>
            <li>Finally, attach the head on top of the neck.</li>
        </ol>
