    <h1>DESIGN MEMO</h1>
    <p>
        Aidan and I did different sketches of how we want our robot to look. We looked at each other's sketches and came to a conclusion. We used some ideas from his sketches and then some from mine and created a final sketch together. Once we both approved that this is how we want our robot to look we started finding pieces from our Lego Set that we thought would fit together in order to create our robot. It took us a lot of time to put the robot together and once we had it together we broke it apart and put all the pieces aside. I started writing the steps on a piece of paper as Aidan started building the robot back together. As Aidan was putting the pieces together we would stop after about 5 pieces to write down the instructions together to make it easier. Aidan was able to talk about what he was making which made it easier to write the instructions down. With this Abdur was able to create instructions with better vocabulary for the average person to understand. We kept doing this process over and over again until Aidan was done building the robot. Once Aidan was done with the robot we looked over all of the instructions again and made more tweaks to the instructions so it would be easier for the reader to read. <br><br><br>

        Once the instructions were done, Aidan went and built the robot again. We did this because we wanted to see if the instructions made sense. Everytime Aidan would struggle on a step in the instructions we would fix that part in the instructions until Aidan got it down. We kept fixing different parts of the instructions until Aidan was done building the robot. <br><br><br>

        After Aidan built the Robot off of the instructions, Aidan built it again with the new and improved instructions. With this Aidan was able to complete the lego robot and was able to look at the instructions with no pauses or mess ups. With this we knew that our instructions were ready to go because we tested the instructions out multiple times and re-worded them multiple times.
