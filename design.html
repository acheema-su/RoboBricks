    <h1>DESIGN MEMO</h1>
    <p>
        Our objective in designing the website was to create a nice visual experience that immediately captures visitors' attention upon entering the RoboBricks website. The way that we designed the homepage was to make it pop and stand out when you click on our website. The reason for that is that we want our viewers to really engage with RoboBricks. An important feature on the homepage is the mission statement, it provides the visitors with a quick insight into our purpose. We chose the color blue as the background color because it aligns perfectly with our robot's color. It enhances the overall aesthetic appeal of the website. <br><br><br>

        Placing navigation at the top ensured easy access to the key sections such as instructions and usability, prioritizing user experience and efficient exploration of the website. We chose the text pop-out function because it creates a welcoming mood when someone opens the website. <br><br><br>
        
        On the Instruction page, we maintained our commitment to user-friendliness. The instructions page includes clear and high-quality images with step numbers and detailed descriptions of the steps. We made the heading bold and bigger than the other text on the page to make it pop out. We placed the images on the left and the text on the right so itâ€™s easy for the user to understand the instructions with visuals. <br><br><br>
        
        For the Usability page, we kept it really simple and put pictures of the people building our robot and looking at the instructions. We also made sure that the website is responsive across all devices including laptops, desktops, and mobile phones. We also optimized the images for faster loading times.
