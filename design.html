    <h1>DESIGN MEMO</h1>
    <p>
        The way that we designed the homepage was to make it pop and stand out when you click on our website. The reason for that is because we want our viewers to really engage with RoboBricks. We also added a mission statement to our homepage to show what RoboBricks is all about. We chose the color blue as the background color because it aligns perfectly with our robot's color. The navigation is on the top of the page, easy to navigate key sections of the website like instructions and usability. We chose the text pop out function because it creates a welcoming mood when someone opens the website. The instructions page includes clear and high quality images with step number and detailed description of the step. We made the heading bold and bigger than the other text on the page to make it pop out. For the instruction we placed the images on the left and the text on the right so itâ€™s easy for the user to understand the instruction with visuals. We also made sure that the website is responsive across all devices including laptops, desktop and mobile phones. We also optimized the images for faster loading times.
