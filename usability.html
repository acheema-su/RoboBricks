    <h1>USABILITY TESTING</h1>
    <p>Our focus group for building this robot is for people who are starting to get into making legos. Legos can be tricky and challenging at first, but making a simple robot is a good step into making more advanced lego types. In our instructions page we did not make the vocabulary too complex. We wanted the reader to understand what they were making and not have them confused while making the robot. If we made the directions simple and easy to understand then it would not be challenging for a person with no prior knowledge on legos to make this simple robot lego. <br> <br> <br>

        For the first group of people that we decided to choose from were 2 guys. We both had them test this lego by looking at the instructions provided and the pictures that were provided in the instructions. For both of the guys that were making the lego, they had no problems with steps 1 through 8. With this, that was expected because it is only the base level instructions. This lego is for beginners and people who don't make legos all the time, so not struggling on the base part of the lego was making a lot of sense. Once they started to get to step 9 and above they both started to struggle with making the lego. Once you are on step 9 there are a lot of pieces going all over the place and I can see why the two guys doing this lego were starting to struggle. It took them more time to fill out the following step but they were able to get most of it done perfectly. One of the guys messed up on step 10 as he put the pieces on backwards but he later figured it out by looking at the picture. Another one of the guys messed up on step 12 as he could not figure out how to build the head. But overall these 2 guys gave us very good test results. Both of them do not use legos or build legos and they only struggled on a couple of steps. This makes sense because lego building can be hard and when you don't build legos, things are not always gonna go smoothly. But it was easy enough where they could get most of it done and that was our goal with the lego and the instructions. <br> <br> <br>

        The next group of people that we tested were 2 girls. One of them has built legos in the past and has built some pretty big lego sets. The other girl has heard about legos, but has never actually built lego sets before. We wanted to use one person who has built legos in the past because we wanted to see if the instructions were easy enough for the average lego builder. The girl who has built legos in the past had no problem making this lego. She was zooming through the lego instructions the whole time. The only part where she took her time a little bit was the head part of the instructions. When she was done everything was in the right place and she completed the lego very fast. When we got these results we were happy with them because that means that our instructions paid off and they were not too hard to follow. The girl that has not made legos in the past had quite the similar experience as the other two guys. She was fine from step 1 through 12, but she started to struggle on the head part of the instructions. Once she took her time she was able to finish the lego in a reasonable time with only a couple pieces not in the right spots.
        <br> <br> <br>
        Overall with the instructions, it was a success for us. Like we said before these instructions should be good for people that have not made legos in the past. The three people that have not built legos in the past overall did a very good job with only a few mistakes. With this we could have added a little bit more steps, especially on the head part of the instructions because that is where most of the people messed up. But overall the wording of our instructions were better than expected. I thought more people would get tripped up on it, but they seem to not get too confused. We were very happy that the person who has built legos in the past was able to make our lego fairly easy. We found out that our instructions were very easy for an average builder in legos.
